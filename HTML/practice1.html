            Rosa Parks stood up as a minority. 
            <p align="middle"> <u>African Americans had been segregated and 
            mistreated at the time so they couldn't sit on the bus if a white person didn't already 
            have a seat to sit in.
            </u>
            <br/> Rosa Parks remained seated when a white person told them to stand up,
            and she was arrested but it raised awareness.</p>
