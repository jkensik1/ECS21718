  <p>All my life I have been playing basketball, basically year-round. I've played on multiple teams, including travel, camps, and school teams. The most beneficial teams were my travel team(OTE hoops), and my high school team (Lane Tech).</p>

  <p>Over The Edge was my first team to play on besides my school team. This program helped me learn about my fundamentals for basketball and helped me in every aspect. I am also still friends with the people on the team to this day.</p>

  <p>This was probably my most demanding and time consuming team. Waking up everyday at around 5:30 am to go to school early and run and play basketball was really tiring. Especially because the end of practice only meant the start of school, which already was hard to go to. Although the practices were tiring sometimes, it was all worth it in the end with the games and scrimaging.</p>
