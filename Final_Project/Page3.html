      <h3>How I started</h3>
      <p>All my life always envied shoes, but I never had the money to be buying them. When I was 14, 
      I finally saved enough to buy a pair. I went to a store to buy them, and they 
      were on sale, $100 instead of $180. They had my size, and I ended up buying a pair. A few days later I hadn't of worn them because I didn't like them as much as I did, so I sold them on ebay for $150.</p>

      <h3>Practice...</h3>
      <p>The only way I could really practice reselling them was knowing where and when some shoes sold, and knowing how to buy 
      shoes. Social media accounts and sneaker info instagram accounts gives me lots of the information I need to get the shoes whether its wating in line for hours,
      winning a raffle, purchasing them online or reserving them online and picking them up in</p>

      <p> person. Over time, I just kept trying to buy every reslease that would sell out fast and give the shoes high
      resell value. Although sometimes,
      you might not get the pair of shoes because it already sold out.
      All of these things give experience for the future.</p>
